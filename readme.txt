== Description ==

Create custom "Contact Us" forms and place them on pages on your  WP site.  The plugin can also create an entry into the user's account on <a href="http://www.salesgoals.com">SalesGoals.com</a> online CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) system.  This entry will effectively become both a new contact record and a to-do item for follow up.

The SalesGoals.com site is free, as is the plugin.  The plugin will place an embedded link for "powered by SalesGoals.com" only for free accounts.  Paid users will not have a link shown on their site.

The plugin will store the SalesGoals.com account credentials in the WP database.  It has a link to remove these credentials from the user from.  The plugin also supports customizable fields and reCAPTCHA for spam protection.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
